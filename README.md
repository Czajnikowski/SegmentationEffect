# SegmentationEffect

This effect allows you to transform the geometry of your regular, rectangular SwiftUI `View`s into quadrilateral segments ‚è¢, so you can do fun things like:

The shader uses bilinear interpolation to map pixel positions to the output via `View.distortionEffect`. The repository features an editor app that allows you to give it a try in an interactive way.

## How To Use It?

Use as a Swift Package.

Use a [`View.segmentationEffect`](https://github.com/Czajnikowski/SegmentationEffect/blob/main/Sources/SegmentationEffect/SegmentationEffect.swift#L4-L19) modifier.

## Why?

I made it mostly for myself as an exercise in my recent `SwiftUI` + `Metal` research. At this point APIs have not been crafted very carefully, so the possibilities of the package are quite limited, but give it a try, and be sure to let me know if you like it. I can definitely spend some more time on it, if it is of use for anybody in a real project. At this point - it simply "works for me‚Ñ¢Ô∏è" ‚è∏Ô∏èüòÅ
